- Sets HTTP status code to 500 on system errors but only in devmode and in
  tests.


1.9.0 (2010-10-13)
------------------

1.8.1 (2010-10-11)
------------------

- Doing redirect in ``UnauthorizedPagelet`` now in ``update`` method instead

  all permissions for running tests successfully.

- Got rid of `zope.app.testing` test dependency by using `zope.app.wsgi`.

- Added a test for ``403 Forbidden``.


1.8.0 (2010-08-20)

  dependencies as it is needed in the ZCML configuration.

  system error pagelet to not found pagelet.

- Cleaned up dependencies, reflecting changes in zope packages.

- Cleaned up test dependencies.


1.5.0 (2009-05-28)
------------------

- Removed dependency on ``zope.app.exception`` by using
  ``zope.browser>=1.2`` and by implementing the exception view classes
  directly instead of inheriting them (Quite nothing of the base
  classes was in use here.)

- Removed not necessary test dependency on ``zope.app.twisted``.

- Removed no longer necessary test dependency on ``zope.app.component``.


1.4.0 (2009-03-16)
------------------

- Removed direct dependency on ``zope.app.security`` by using the new
  packages ``zope.authentication`` and ``zope.principalregistry``.

1.3.0 (2009-03-13)
------------------

- Implemented login and logout using pagelets resp. viewlets.

- Updated tests to use new ``zope.configuration`` which containts the
  exclude directive.


1.2.1 (2009-02-21)
------------------

- Release 1.2.0 was missing the test file for the security issue.


1.2.0 (2009-02-21)
------------------

- **Security issue:** The traverser defined for
  ``IPageletBrowserLayer`` was a trusted adapter, so the security
  proxy got removed from each traversed object. Thus all sub-objects
  were publically accessable, too.


1.1.0 (2009-02-14)
------------------

- Bugfix: use IContentTemplate instead of IPageTemplate which avoids to get the
  layout template if no IPageTemplate is registered.

- Using ``zope.location.interfaces.ISite`` instead of
  ``zope.app.component.interfaces.ISite``.

- Using ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.

- Cleaned up dependencies.


1.0.2 (2009-04-03)
------------------

- backport release, see release date

- **Security issue:** The traverser defined for
  ``IPageletBrowserLayer`` was a trusted adapter, so the security
  proxy got removed from each traversed object. Thus all sub-objects
  were publically accessable, too.

  Making this change might BREAK your application!
  That means if security is not well declared.

- Bugfix: use IContentTemplate instead of IPageTemplate which avoids to get the
  layout template if no IPageTemplate is registered

0.2.3 (2007-11-07)
------------------

- Forward-Bug: Due to a bug in mechanize, the testbrowser throws
  ``httperror_seek_wrapper`` instead of ``HTTPError`` errors. Thanks to RE
  normalizers, the code will now work whether the bug is fixed or not in
  mechanize.
